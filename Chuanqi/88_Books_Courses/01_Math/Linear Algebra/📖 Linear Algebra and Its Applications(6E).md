> A vector space is a nonempty set V of objects, called vectors, on which are defined two operations, called addition and multiplication by scalars (real numbers), subject to the ten axioms (or rules) listed below. The axioms must hold for all vectors u, v, and w in V and for all scalars c and d

> A subspace of a vector space V is a subset H of V that has three properties: 
> a. The zero vector of V is in H
> b. H is closed under vector addition
> c. H is closed under multiplication by scalars

> THEOREM 1 
> If $v_1 \cdots v_p$ are in a vector space V , then Span {$v_1 \cdot v_p$} is a subspace of V .
