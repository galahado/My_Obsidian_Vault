## Chapter 3. Vector Spaces and Subspaces
### 3.1 Spaces of Vectors
### 3.2 The Nullspace of A
The [[null space]] N(A) consists of all solutions to [[Ax = 0]]. 
These vectors x are in $R^n$

> The nullspace of A consists of all combinations of the special solutions to [[Ax = 0]]
 >special solution: set one of the free variables to 1 and others to 0 
 >free variable: variable correspondent to the column with no pivot
