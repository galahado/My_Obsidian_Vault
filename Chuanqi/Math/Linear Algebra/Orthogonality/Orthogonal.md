### Orthogonal Vectors
2 vectors $v, w$ are _orthogonal_ when $v^Tw = 0$ which means $\|v\|^2 + \|w\|^2 = \|v+w\|^2$ 

$\|v+w\|^2$ can be seen as $(v+w)^T(v+w)$


### Orthogonal Subspaces
subspaces $V$ and $W$ are _orthogonal_ when $v^Tw = 0$ for all $v$ in $V$ and all $w$ in $W$

when a vector is in two orthogonal [[Subspace|Subspaces]], it must be zero

 Every vector x in the [[Null Space|nullspace]] is perpendicular to every row of A, because $Ax = 0$. 
 The [[Null Space|nullspace]] N(A) and the row space $C(A^T)$ are _orthogonal subspaces_ of $R^n$ .

The [[Left Nullspace]] $N(A^T)$ and the [[Column Space]] $C(A)$ are orthogonal in $R^m$
