Amazon MQ is a Message broker service allowing easier migration of existing applications to the AWS Cloud

If migrating existing applications with messaging systems in place, you likely want to consider Amazon MQ

If creating new applications, look at [[Simple Queue Service|SQS]] and [[Simple Notification Service|SNS]] that are simpler to use, highly scalable, and simple APIs. Good fit for most new use cases!
