        - stateless or stateful→stateful
        - What does stateless mean
            - if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules.
            - similarly, responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.
        - act at what level→instance level
        - kind of rules→Inbound and outbound 
        - have both allow and deny rules?→no, only allow rules

            - 32766
        - What happens when a client connects to a server?→A random port is generated from the ephemeral port range (like 1024-65535) to become the client's source port.  
        - What needs to be allowed in the network ACL to connect to a service running on an instance?→Both inbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on and outbound traffic from ephemeral ports.  
        - What are the rules of a default NACL?→All inbound and outbound traffic is allowed.

    - Implement a fanout messaging.→Create an [SNS](AWS/Application%20Integrat%20ion/SNS.md) topic with a message filtering policy and configure multiple [SQS](AWS/Application%20Integrat%20ion/SQS.md) queues to subscribe to the topic.
    - A database that has a read replication latency of less than 1 second.→Use Amazon Aurora with cross-region replicas.
    - Retrieve a subset of data from a large CSV file stored in the [S3](AWS/Storage/S3.md) bucket.→Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket’s name and object’s key.
    - Encrypt [EBS](AWS/Storage/EBS.md) volumes restored from the unencrypted EBS snapshots→Copy the snapshot and enable encryption with a new symmetric CMK while creating an EBS volume using the snapshot.
    - Limit the maximum number of requests from a single IP address.→Create a rate-based rule in [WAF ](AWS/Security/WAF.md) and set the rate limit.
    - Grant the bucket owner full access to all uploaded objects in the [S3](AWS/Storage/S3.md) bucket.→Create a [Bucket Policy](AWS/Storage/S3/access%20control/Bucket%20Policy.md) that requires users to set the object’s ACL to bucket-owner-full-control.
    - Protect objects in the [S3](AWS/Storage/S3.md) bucket from accidental deletion or overwrite.→Enable versioning and MFA delete.
    - Secure the web application by allowing multiple domains to serve SSL traffic over the same IP address.→Use AWS Certificate Manager to generate an SSL certificate. Associate the certificate to the CloudFront distribution and enable Server Name Indication ([SNI]())
    - Control the access for several [S3](AWS/Storage/S3.md) buckets by using a [Gateway Endpoint ](AWS/Network/VPC%20Endpoint/Gateway%20Endpoint.md) to allow access to trusted buckets.→Create an endpoint policy for trusted S3 buckets.
    - Provide short-lived access tokens that act as temporary security credentials to allow access to AWS resources.→Use [STS](AWS/Security/STS.md)
    - Encrypt and rotate all the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets on a regular basis.
        - Use [Secrets Manager](AWS/Security/Secrets%20Manager.md) and enable automatic rotation of credentials.
    - Accelerate the transfer of historical records from on-premises to AWS over the Internet in a cost-effective manner.→Use [DataSync](AWS/Storage/DataSync.md) and select Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive as the destination.
    - Minimize the data transfer costs between two EC2 instances.→Deploy the EC2 instances in the same Region.
    - Import the SSL/TLS certificate of the application.→Import the certificate into AWS Certificate Manager or upload it to AWS IAM.

        - Amazon [SQS](AWS/Application%20Integrat%20ion/SQS.md)(Simple Queue Service)
        - Amazon Kinesis
        - AWS [Lambda](AWS/Serverless/Lambda.md)
        - Amazon [API Gateway  ](AWS/Serverless/API%20Gateway.md)
    - How to share a service through [PrivateLink](AWS/Network/PrivateLink.md)? >>>
        - create a [Network Load Balancer ](AWS/Availability%20%26%20Scalability/ELB/Network%20Load%20Balancer.md) in your [VPC ](AWS/Network/VPC.md) as the service frontend
        - create vpc endpoint service using this NLB
        - as a consumer, create an [Interface Endpoint ](AWS/Network/VPC%20Endpoint/Interface%20Endpoint.md) and connect to the service
