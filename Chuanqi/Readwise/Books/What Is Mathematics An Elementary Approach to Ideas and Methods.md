- Summary: The text discusses various mathematical topics such as geometry, numbers, and algebra. It explores fundamental principles and methods used in mathematics, including constructions, equations, and geometric transformations. The author aims to present a comprehensive view of mathematics from elementary concepts to advanced applications.

## Highlights
- Recorded mathematics begins in the Orient, where, about 2000 B.C., the Babylonians collected a great wealth of material that we would classify today under elementary algebra ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h530k9qg4bn3b5gt8gy9yxyn))

- Yet as a science in the modern sense mathematics only emerges later, on Greek soil, in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h534mp5j51g6s27f05y52n2t))

    - Note: Leopold Kronecker was a German mathematician who made contributions to number theory and algebra. He believed that the foundation of mathematics was rooted in the natural numbers and their relations, and was skeptical of the use of infinity and other abstract concepts in mathematical reasoning. Kronecker's ideas had a significant impact on the development of mathematics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

- it has become the modern guiding principle that all mathematical statements should be reducible ultimately to statements about the *natural numbers* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h558ey77ygkf8hnrkgrdkgyj))
