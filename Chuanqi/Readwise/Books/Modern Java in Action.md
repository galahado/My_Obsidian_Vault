   A: In Java, streams represent a sequence of elements supporting various operations for processing data in a functional style, allowing for operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing. Streams differ from collections in that they support internal iteration and can be processed in parallel, enabling more concise and efficient data handling. Key operations include intermediate operations (like filter and map) that return a new stream and terminal operations (like collect and forEach) that produce a result or side effect.

- Summary: Java 8 introduces a Streams API that allows developers to process data in a more abstract and efficient way, enabling operations like filtering and mapping on collections. This API takes advantage of parallel processing, making it easier to write concise and optimized code without manually managing threads. Additionally, Java 8 incorporates lambda expressions and functional interfaces, enhancing the way developers work with collections and enabling more reusable code.

## Highlights
- Streams are an update to the Java API that let you manipulate collections of data in a declarative way (you express a query rather than code an ad hoc implementation for it). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgm9kpvkppwe9z6jky0kpkde))
