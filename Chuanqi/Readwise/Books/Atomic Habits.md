- Summary: "Atomic Habits" by James Clear offers a simple plan for building better habits that last a lifetime. It explains how small changes can lead to significant improvements over time and emphasizes the importance of making habits attractive, easy, and satisfying. The book provides practical strategies to help you create and maintain good habits while breaking bad ones.

## Highlights
- • Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
  • Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
  • Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
  • An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
  • If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
  • You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4apkhbcr1pet8s42d5ftwrx))

- • There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
  • The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
  • Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
  • Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
  • The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4apmn1xyhe4mep4j87ajg1c))

- • A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
  • The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
  • Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
  • The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4apz87y1pvcf7nkgtp20hkb))
