- Summary: The text explains basic operations of a computer's CPU, focusing on the role of the register file and the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU). It highlights how registers store important data like addresses and local variables, which allows for faster access than memory. Additionally, it discusses how instructions are executed and the impact of dependencies on performance.

## Highlights
- Rather than accessing individual bits in memory, most computers use blocks of 8 bits, or *bytes*, as the smallest addressable unit of memory. A machine-level program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as *virtual memory*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyrx1t6jt4y7165rr4pza0y0))

- Every byte of memory is identified by a unique number, known as its *address*, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the *virtual address space*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyrx286cx8v716a9dkhqqvdj))

- Every computer has a *word size*, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyrzw9axdy7jxqy7w6g9p550))

- for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from 0 to 2w â€” 1, giving the program access to at most 2w bytes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jys00ncqy09q6wh1zzdnzs9d))
