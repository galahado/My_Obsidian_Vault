- Summary: Rereading and massed practice, like cramming, may feel easy but are not effective for long-term learning. Instead, effortful retrieval, such as self-quizzing, strengthens memory and retention even if it feels difficult. True mastery comes from actively reconstructing knowledge rather than simply reviewing it.

## Highlights
- What’s apparent from the research is that gains achieved during massed practice are transitory and melt away quickly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4ebhdpjctq5ggzfgmbs3gyq))

- What’s the conclusion? It makes sense to reread a text once if there’s been a meaningful lapse of time since the first reading, but doing multiple readings in close succession is a time-consuming study strategy that yields negligible benefits at the expense of much more effective strategies that take less time.

- The illusion of mastery is an example of poor metacognition: what we know about what we know. Being accurate in your judgment of what you know and don’t know is critical for decision making. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4fy0y33kz3kwyfzebs0h2zm))

- Learning is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful. Learning that’s easy is like writing in sand, here today and gone tomorrow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j41g6jp9b64r3sgc1gphc81e))

- Retrieval practice—recalling facts or concepts or events from memory—is a more effective learning strategy than review by rereading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42283aj07xj8sr9vyf84dff))

- When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings.

- Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j422hrtv51gbbbp54d0bhamt))

- However, if you practice elaboration, there’s no known limit to how much you can learn. Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know.

- People who learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j46sdm45jg7kmz1c2rn30ab4))
