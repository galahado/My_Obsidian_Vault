- Summary: Rereading and massed practice, like cramming, may feel easy but are not effective for long-term learning. Instead, effortful retrieval, such as self-quizzing, strengthens memory and retention even if it feels difficult. True mastery comes from actively reconstructing knowledge rather than simply reviewing it.
