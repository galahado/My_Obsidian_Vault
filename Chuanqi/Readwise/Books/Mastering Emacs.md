## Highlights
- That is one thing non-users seize on as it is skin-deep and easy to critique: that the terminology is baroque; the UI brutalist; and the key bindings byzantine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfb4d8b9cbjhz681yhmr2bg2))

- Covering *all* of Emacs in just one book would be a Sisyphean task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdg1s75jyxz5akfk5gpgf04q))

- The point is just another word for the *caret* or *cursor*. The Emacs documentation is rather inconsistent in its use of *point* or *cursor*; you will see both. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdjq2dvf5tx1anp553dmvsdp))

- The first – and perhaps most abhorrent, to beginners – deviation from *de-facto* user interface standards is Emacs’s clipboard system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jf2t2mf7zn35v3qqj2v5qy20))

- The universal argument is shorthand for the number 4. If you type `C-u a`, Emacs will print `aaaa` on your screen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jf3308kffbq8ctx3pkvswx2c))
