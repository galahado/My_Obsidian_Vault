- Summary: "Mastering Emacs" by Mickey Petersen explains the unique features and philosophy of the Emacs text editor, which sets it apart from others. It emphasizes efficient navigation and editing techniques, highlighting the importance of understanding key bindings and buffers. The book also discusses how Emacs can be customized and is self-documenting, making it a powerful tool for developers.

- Emacs applies two other important heuristics you should know about: *coding systems* and *line endings*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr5hs78kcyzmsxwwhx38dmq8))
