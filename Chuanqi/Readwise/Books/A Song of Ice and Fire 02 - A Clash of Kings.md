Syrio Forel is a master swordsman from the Free City of Braavos, known for his skill in water dancing. He serves as Arya Stark's sword-fighting instructor in King's Landing.

- Rorge‚Äôs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6hjd0n02bv7cq9h2edj7433))
    - Note: Rorge, also known as "the Noseless Man," is a brutish figure marked by his missing nose, replaced by a gaping hole that grotesquely distorts his face, and a perpetual sneer that reveals his crooked, yellowed teeth. In "A Clash of Kings," he is a prisoner who becomes part of the dangerous band known as the Brave Companions, serving as a violent enforcer alongside his equally menacing companion, Biter. Rorge is characterized by his crude humor, sadistic tendencies, and a primal, intimidating presence, often resorting to threats and violence to assert dominance, particularly over the vulnerable, like Arya Stark, whom he targets with his lewd taunts and menacing behavior. His backstory hints at a life steeped in crime and brutality, having been captured and chained alongside other criminals, including Jaqen H'ghar, and he revels in the chaos and violence that accompanies their escapades. Key characters closely tied to Rorge include Biter (his equally savage accomplice), Jaqen H'ghar (a fellow prisoner with mysterious powers), and Arya Stark (a target of Rorge's threats and intimidation).

    - Note: Biter, also known as "the cannibal," is a hulking figure with pale skin, a mouth full of yellowed, pointed teeth, and a body marked by scars and burns, exuding an unsettling presence. In "A Clash of Kings," he serves as a brutal enforcer and companion to the sellsword group known as the Brave Companions, often engaged in acts of violence and terror against their enemies. Biter's personality is characterized by a primal ferocity and a penchant for hissing, making him both fearsome and unpredictable, and his history is shrouded in mystery, hinting at a past filled with brutality and lost humanity, as he is depicted as a man who has succumbed to the more savage instincts of survival. Key characters with strong ties to Biter include Rorge (his equally violent companion) and Jaqen H'ghar (a more enigmatic figure who shares a bond of circumstance with Biter and Rorge).
