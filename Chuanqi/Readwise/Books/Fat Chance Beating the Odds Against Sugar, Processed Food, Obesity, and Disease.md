- Summary: The book "Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease," by Robert H. Lustig, explores the problem of obesity and associated diseases as a result of altered biochemistry in our environment. The author argues that obesity is a problem of nutrition and activity, not endocrinology. Sugar consumption, particularly fructose, is a driving factor behind chronic metabolic diseases, not just obesity. The book also critiques popular diet trends, highlights the importance of endogenous micronutrients in preventing metabolic syndrome, and stresses the need for public health solutions to address the obesity pandemic.

## Highlights
- There are three problems with “*a calorie is a calorie.*” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4tgz3dkabdtmrsywv2h4re6))

- First, there is no way anyone could actually burn off the calories supplied by our current food supply ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4thgg06nejzzmgsebvywyjm))

- No. So why do the medications stop working? The answer: because the body is smarter than the brain is ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4thjbkyzfzw1m8xrzbaaedp))

- Energy expenditure is reduced to meet the decreased energy intake. So a calorie is *not* really a calorie, because your caloric output is controlled by your body and is dependent on the quantity *and* the quality of the calories ingested ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4thk39j40wecyer6yvxekja))

- Second, if *a calorie is a calorie,* then all fats would be the same because they’d each release 9.0 calories per gram of energy when burned. But they’re not all the same ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4thmzdzfyvs4ckc2ty75018))

- There are good fats (which have valuable properties, such as being anti-inflammatory) and bad fats (which can cause heart disease and fatty liver disease; see [chapter 10](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/69274059#None)).

- There are two classes of carbohydrate: starch and sugar. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4thvqb82br2zq7rpnmtqynk))

- The third problem with “*a calorie is a calorie*” is illustrated by the U.S. secretary of health and human services Tommy Thompson’s admonishment in 2004 that we’re “eating too damn much,” would suggest that we’re eating more of everything. But we’re not eating more of *everything.* We’re eating more of some things and less of others. And it is in those “some things” that we will find our answer to the obesity pandemic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4tjbk7c69x8xf11jkbvkevg))
