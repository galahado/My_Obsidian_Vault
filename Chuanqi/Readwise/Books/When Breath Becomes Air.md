## Highlights
- You that seek what life is in death,
  Now find it air that once was breath.
  New names unknown, old names gone:
  Till time end bodies, but souls none.
  Reader! then make time, while you be,
  But steps to your eternity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfftambh1y0979s3f3h3h0dx))
    - Note: Philosophical Interpretations of Breath as a Metaphor for Life and Death: Breath is often viewed as a powerful symbol in philosophy, representing the essence of life and the inevitability of death. Many thinkers suggest that the act of breathing reflects the cyclical nature of existence, where each inhalation signifies life and each exhalation signifies the release of vitality. This metaphor underscores the interconnectedness of living beings and the transient nature of life, prompting deeper reflection on the meaning of existence and mortality.
