- Summary: The content discusses linear maps, bases, invertibility, isomorphisms, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and upper-triangular matrices in linear algebra. It covers topics such as the structure of linear maps, the matrix of the identity operator, equations satisfied by operators with specific matrices, and properties of eigenspaces.

## Highlights
- If 𝑎 ∈ 𝐑, we identify 𝑎 + 0𝑖 with the real number 𝑎. Thus we think of 𝐑 as a
  subset of 𝐂 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyxthy5cz9j1qc2wdcpr8cxx))

- Throughout this book, 𝐅 stands for either 𝐑 or 𝐂. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyxv1mb4k57rasn25vrcx717))

- The letter 𝐅 is used because 𝐑 and 𝐂 are examples ofwhat are called fields. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyxv1s0rtdxc9cvgtxr97fvz))
