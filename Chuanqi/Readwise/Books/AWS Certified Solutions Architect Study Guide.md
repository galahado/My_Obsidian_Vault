- Summary: AWS manages the physical infrastructure of its cloud services, while customers are responsible for the configuration and security of their EC2 instances and data. The platform offers tools to help migrate applications to the cloud and ensures that most resources can automatically scale to meet demand. Additionally, AWS provides various security measures, including IAM policies and resource-based policies, to control access to services and data.

## Highlights
- Security groups control traffic at the instance level. However, AWS also provides you with network access control lists (NACLs) that are associated with entire subnets rather than individual instances. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvmzevk2bfvsb20hxfdh79kt))

- You define an IAM role by giving it permissions to perform actions on specified services or resources within your AWS account. When a particular role is assigned to a user or resource, they'll gain access to whichever resources were included in the role policies.

- An EC2 security group plays the role of a firewall. By default, a security group will deny all incoming traffic while permitting all outgoing traffic. You define group behavior by setting policy rules that will either block or allow specified traffic types. From that point on, any data packet coming into or leaving the perimeter will be measured against those rules and processed accordingly.
