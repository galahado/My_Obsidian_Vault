- Summary: AWS manages the physical infrastructure of its cloud services, while customers are responsible for the configuration and security of their EC2 instances and data. The platform offers tools to help migrate applications to the cloud and ensures that most resources can automatically scale to meet demand. Additionally, AWS provides various security measures, including IAM policies and resource-based policies, to control access to services and data.

## Highlights
- **General Purpose** The General Purpose family includes T3, T2, M5, and M4 types, which all aim to provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. T2 types, for instance, range from the t2.nano with one virtual CPU (vCPU0) and half a gigabyte of memory all the way up to the t2.2xlarge with its eight vCPUs and 32 GB of memory. Because it's eligible as part of the Free Tier, the t2.micro is often a good choice for experimenting. But there's nothing stopping you from using it for light-use websites and various development-related services.
