- Summary: The book "The Elements of Computing Systems" teaches how to build hardware and software systems, starting with projects that use a simple Hardware Description Language (HDL). It emphasizes the importance of understanding low-level programming, as it helps in writing better high-level programs. The Hack CPU executes instructions in the Hack machine language, and an assembler is used to translate symbolic programs into binary code for execution.
