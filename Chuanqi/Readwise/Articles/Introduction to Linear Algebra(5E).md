- The nullspace N(A) consists of all solutions to Ax= 0. These vectors x are in Rn _ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhz3vfnp9rkb9w63drvdpydk))

- To repeat: The solution vectors x have n components. They are vectors in Rn, so the nullspace is a subspace of Rn. The column space C(A) is a subspace of Rm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhz3x4ny1569qh84w46nmk5j))

- This is the best way to describe the nullspace, by computing special solutions to Ax = 0. The solution is special because we set the free variable to x2 = 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhz42jyqmzvjw4n1f733d887))

- The nullspace of A consists of all combinations of the special solutions to Ax = 0. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhz41zbqtyzr3sphjya9dcqn))
