- Summary: Java 8 introduces a Streams API that allows developers to process data in a more abstract and efficient way, enabling operations like filtering and mapping on collections. This API takes advantage of parallel processing, making it easier to write concise and optimized code without manually managing threads. Additionally, Java 8 incorporates lambda expressions and functional interfaces, enhancing the way developers work with collections and enabling more reusable code.

## Highlights
