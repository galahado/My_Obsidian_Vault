    - Note: Herman Melville: Herman Melville (1819-1891) 赫尔曼·梅尔维尔 was an American novelist and poet best known for his novel "Moby-Dick", a literary masterpiece that explores themes of obsession, fate, and the nature of evil. Born in New York City, Melville spent much of his youth in Albany before embarking on a career as a sailor, which inspired much of his writing. In addition to "Moby-Dick", Melville's works include "Typee", "Billy Budd", and "Bartleby, the Scrivener". Despite initial critical indifference, Melville's writing has since been recognized for its complexity and depth, making him one of the most important figures in American literature.
