- Summary: In 2019, Tulsi Gabbard met with Elias Khawam, who claimed to have information about American journalist Austin Tice being held in Syria. Gabbard denies knowing about this meeting or any communication with the Assad regime, despite claims that she acted as a conduit between Trump and Assad. Her nomination as director of national intelligence raises concerns due to her past views on dictators and selective use of information.
