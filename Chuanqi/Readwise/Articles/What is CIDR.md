- Summary: Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for allocating IP addresses that enhances internet routing efficiency. It allows organizations to use flexible subnetting, reducing IP address waste and improving data transmission speed. CIDR is essential for modern networking, including IPv6, and is supported by services like Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
