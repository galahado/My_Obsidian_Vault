[[Introduction to Linear Algebra(5E).pdf#page=121&selection=279,1,291,9|ðŸ“–]] A _symmetric matrix_ has $S^T = S$ . This means that $S_{ji} = S_{ij}$

[[Introduction to Linear Algebra(5E).pdf#page=122&selection=8,0,32,0|ðŸ“–]] The [[Inverse]] of a symmetric matrix is also symmetric. 
proof
The transpose of $S^{-1}$ is $(S^{-1})^T = (S^T)^-1 = s-1$

[[Introduction to Linear Algebra(5E).pdf#page=122&selection=119,0,122,44|ðŸ“–]] For any $A,$ $A^TA$ and $AA^T$ are square symmetric matrices
proof:
$(A^TA)^T = A^T(A^T)^T = A^TA$
