- Summary: The text explains the relationship between C, assembly code, and machine code, focusing on x86-64 architecture. It covers how control structures, procedures, and data structures are implemented at the machine level, along with potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflow attacks. The chapter also discusses the roles of different registers and how operations are executed in a program.

- Every computer has a word size, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. Since a virtual address is encoded by such a word, the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space. That is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from 0 to 2w ‚àí 1, giving the program access to at most 2w bytes.

- Somemachines choose to store the ob- ject in memory ordered from least signiÔ¨Åcant byte to most, while other machines store them from most to least. The former convention‚Äîwhere the least signiÔ¨Åcant byte comes Ô¨Årst‚Äîis referred to as little endian. The latter convention‚Äîwhere the most signiÔ¨Åcant byte comes Ô¨Årst‚Äîis referred to as big endian. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkchchn42tab587zc0jz6fdb))

- Most Intel-compatible machines operate exclusively in little-endian mode. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkcjjnneag748kj9qm4421ze))

- Many recent microprocessor chips are bi-endian, meaning that they can be conÔ¨Ågured to operate as either little- or big-endian machines. In practice, however, byte ordering becomes Ô¨Åxed once a particular operating system is chosen. For example, ARM microprocessors, used in many cell phones, have hardware that can operate in either little- or big-endian mode, but the two most common operating systems for these chips‚ÄîAndroid (from Google) and IOS (from Apple)‚Äîoperate only in little-endian mode.

- One useful application of bit vectors is to represent finite sets. We can encode
  any subsetA‚äÜ{0, 1, ... , w ‚àí 1} with a bit vector [aw‚àí1,. . .,a1,a0], where ai = 1if and only if i ‚ààA. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkfvehas0x8a5mkcgjcz0h81))

- . In practice, however, almost all compiler/machine combinations use arithmetic right shifts for signed data, and many programmers assume this to be the case. For unsigned data, on the other hand, right shifts must be logical. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkh78mfepk1n7zrnf7zhe09k))

- When an operation is performed where one operand is signed and the other is unsigned, C implicitly casts the signed argument to unsigned and performs the operations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkktd6ytkxq5x9k9abt7rka1))

- The ELF header begins with a 16-byte sequence that describes the word size and byte ordering of the system that generated the Ô¨Åle. The rest of the ELF header contains information that allows a linker to parse and interpret the object Ô¨Åle. This includes the size of the ELF header, the object Ô¨Åle type (e.g., relocatable, executable, or shared), the machine type (e.g., x86-64), the Ô¨Åle offset of the section header table, and the size and number of entries in the section header table. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq86apze58b062pntkbpn98v))

- The locations and sizes of the various sections are described by the section header table, which contains a Ô¨Åxed-size entry for each section in the object Ô¨Åle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq86bvvbb04yyz59kts4ajkg))

- .text The machine code of the compiled program. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq86hkwve649e1nhaqh00nay))

- .rodata Read-only data such as the format strings in printf statements, and jump tables for switch statements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq86hpwd9z5m4esn1ffkphmx))

- .data Initialized global and staticCvariables. LocalCvariables are maintained at run time on the stack and do not appear in either the .data or .bss sections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq86hsecd0fc3nj4xgmhdxvj))

- .bss Uninitialized global and static C variables, along with any global or static variables that are initialized to zero. This section occupies no actual space in the object Ô¨Åle; it is merely a placeholder. Object Ô¨Åle formats distinguish between initialized and uninitialized variables for space efÔ¨Åciency: unini- tialized variables do not have to occupy any actual disk space in the object Ô¨Åle. At run time, these variables are allocated in memory with an initial value of zero. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq86y2q9gpc0ch6xhtw7aztx))

- .symtab A symbol table with information about functions and global variables that are deÔ¨Åned and referenced in the program. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq8787d5pn66wmda07hfh0k7))
