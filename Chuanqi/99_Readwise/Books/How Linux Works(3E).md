- Summary: This chapter explains the main components of a Linux system, focusing on how user processes and the kernel interact. It highlights the importance of Unix commands in understanding Linux, as they apply to other Unix-like systems as well. The chapter also introduces the structure of filesystems and the roles of device files and user-space filesystems in managing system resources.

## Highlights
- The kernel is in charge of managing tasks in four general system areas:
  1. Processes The kernel is responsible for determining which processes are allowed to use the CPU.
  2. Memory The kernel needs to keep track of all memory—what is currently allocated to a particular process, what might be shared between processes, and what is free.
  3. Device drivers The kernel acts as an interface between hardware (such as a disk) and processes. It’s usually the kernel’s job to operate the hardware.
  4. System calls and support Processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j46hmz2hehsjf3egqyk1vw4r))
