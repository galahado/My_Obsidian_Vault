## Highlights
- Covering *all* of Emacs in just one book would be a Sisyphean task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdg1s75jyxz5akfk5gpgf04q))

    - Note: Sisyphean (adjective): endlessly laborious and futile; never-ending struggle 🔄🏔️
      Sisyphus

    - Note: thermonuclear (adjective): relating to or involving the fusion of atomic nuclei at high temperatures, often used metaphorically to describe something powerful or advanced; explosive 🔥💥

- The point is just another word for the *caret* or *cursor*. The Emacs documentation is rather inconsistent in its use of *point* or *cursor*; you will see both. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdjq2dvf5tx1anp553dmvsdp))

- A buffer that *has the point* is the *current buffer* because it is the one you write and move around in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdjqcr453gakrk344eav3h9n))

- The point and mark represents the boundary for a *region*, which is a contiguous block of text, usually, in the current buffer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdjqf1at8sfc4fk7spefszd7))

- That is one thing non-users seize on as it is skin-deep and easy to critique: that the terminology is baroque; the UI brutalist; and the key bindings byzantine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfb4d8b9cbjhz681yhmr2bg2))
