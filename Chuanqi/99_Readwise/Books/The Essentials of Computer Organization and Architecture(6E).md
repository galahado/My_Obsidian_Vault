## Highlights
- Computer organization addresses issues such as control signals (how the computer is controlled), signaling methods, and memory types. It encompasses all physical aspects of computer systems. It helps us to answer the question: How does a computer work? (Location 959)
- The study of computer architecture, on the other hand, focuses on the structure and behavior of the computer system and refers to the logical and abstract aspects of system implementation as seen by the programmer (Location 961)
- The computer architecture for a given machine is the combination of its hardware components plus its instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA is the agreed-upon interface between all the software that runs on the machine and the hardware that executes it. The ISA allows you to talk to the machine. (Location 965)
- A special-purpose computer can be designed to perform any task, such as word processing, budget analysis, or playing a friendly game of Tetris. (Location 984)
