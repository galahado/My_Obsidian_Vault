## Highlights
- Every computer has a word size, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. Since a virtual address is encoded by such a word, the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space. That is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from 0 to 2w â€” 1, giving the program access to at most 2w bytes.
