Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) is a serverless event bus. It allows you to pass events from a source to an endpoint. Essentially, itâ€™s the glue that holds your serverless application together. 

A very common use case is triggering Lambda functions when an AWS API call happens.

EventBridge is the fastest way to respond to things happening in your environment.
