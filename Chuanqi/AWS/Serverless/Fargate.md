## What is Fargate
Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both ECS and EKS.

ECS or EKS is a requirement. Fargate doesnâ€™t work by itself.

## Fargate vs. EC2
Compared to EC2, Fargate is more expensive, but easier to use.

## Fargate vs. Lambda 
Fargate is for containers and applications that need to run longer. 
Lambda excels at short and simple functions.
